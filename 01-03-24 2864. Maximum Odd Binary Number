You are given a binary string s that contains at least one '1'.

You have to rearrange the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.

Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.

Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "010"
Output: "001"
Explanation: Because there is just one '1', it must be in the last position. So the answer is "001".
Example 2:

Input: s = "0101"
Output: "1001"
Explanation: One of the '1's must be in the last position. The maximum number that can be made with the remaining digits is "100". So the answer is "1001".
for get max odd nums the pattern is
1. 01
2. 101
3. 1101

the priority is 
1. 1 in last string
2. 1 in first string
3. and rest append 1 in the first string

           if(str.charAt(i)=='1') c+=1; 
       }
        return c;
    }
    public String maximumOddBinaryNumber(String s) {
        int ones=setBits(s);
        int zeroes=s.length()-ones;
        ones-=1;
        String str=new String();
        str="0".repeat(zeroes)+"1";
        while(ones>0){
            str="1"+str;
            ones-=1;
