You are given an integer array nums of size n and a positive integer k.

Divide the array into one or more arrays of size 3 satisfying the following conditions:

Each element of nums should be in exactly one array.
The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to k.
Return a 2D array containing all the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers, return any of them.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2
Output: [[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]
Explanation: We can divide the array into the following arrays: [1,1,3], [3,4,5] and [7,8,9].
The difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 2.
Note that the order of elements is not important.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,3,2,7,3], k = 3
Output: []
Explanation: It is not possible to divide the array satisfying all the conditions.




public class Solution{
    public int[][] divideArray(int[] nums, int k)
    {
        // Sort the input array in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        // Calculate the number of subarrays to be created
        int numArrays = (int)Math.ceil(nums.length / 3.0);
        // Initialize a 2D array to store the divided arrays
        int[][] ans = new int[numArrays][3];

        // Iterate through the sorted array with a step of 3
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < nums.length; i += 3, j++)
        {
            // Check if there are at least 3 elements remaining and their difference is within k
            if (i + 2 < nums.length && nums[i + 2] - nums[i] <= k)
                // If conditions met, add the current set of elements to the answer array
                ans[j] = new int[]{nums[i + 2], nums[i + 1], nums[i]};
            else
                // If conditions not met, return an empty array
                return new int[0][0];
        }
        // Return the 2D array containing divided arrays
        return ans;
    }
}
